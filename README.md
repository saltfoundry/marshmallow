Marshmallow is a superlight library of syntactic sugar, to help developers make minor styling tweaks to specific elements efficiently and tidily without needing to create specific styling rules.

Whilst I always reccomend considering your CSS structure before delving into development, these Mallows are perfect for pulling together quick prototypes or patching solutions when time is of the essence.
